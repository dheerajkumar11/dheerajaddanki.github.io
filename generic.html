								<p> During my tenure, I played a crucial role in mentoring students by providing constructive feedback on Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs) and SQL queries for MySQL databases. This guidance not only deepened their comprehension of database concepts but also significantly bolstered their database management expertise. In collaboration with faculty members, I helped design challenging yet attainable database-related projects. These projects encouraged critical thinking and brainstorming among students, leading to a remarkable 25% improvement in project completion rates. </p>
								<p>I also demonstrated my proficiency in database management principles, including schema design, indexing, and query optimization, through hands-on assistance and guidance. This practical approach enhanced the students' application skills by 40%, equipping them with the necessary tools to excel in real-world scenarios. My efforts ensured that students not only understood theoretical aspects but also gained valuable practical experience in database management. </p>

								<p> In my role providing L2 support for a Java application, I effectively resolved incident tickets and implemented changes across production, development, and testing environments using Oracle SQL for database queries, achieving an impressive 95% incident resolution rate.

								<p> As a key member of the transition team with Novartis, I served as the primary liaison between the client and the project team, which led to a 15% improvement in client satisfaction scores. I facilitated meetings based on project deadlines and coordinated discussions around the Service Transition report, ensuring smooth project handovers and leading to a 10% increase in on-time project completions. My effective communication strategies ensured that each project was closed upon the completion of deadlines, keeping all stakeholders informed and satisfied with the outcomes, thereby enhancing project stakeholder satisfaction.
